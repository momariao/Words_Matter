# WordsMatter 🌐💬

During the *Women in Engineering Hackathon* held by the University of Waterloo, our team developed an innovative website called *WordsMatter*.

## 💡 What is WordsMatter?

- Analyze and interpret user input in real-time
- Provide suggestions to improve inclusivity in language
- Generate reworded, inclusive alternatives
- Offer feedback to help users better navigate sensitive or exclusive language

## 🛠️ Built With
